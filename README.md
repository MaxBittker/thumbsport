## Instructions:

One player controls the left and right red blobs with their left and right joysticks, and the second player controls the blue blobs.

You must wear a red item of clothing to play as the red player, and a blue item of clothing to be the blue player.
Keep your defending blob away from the opposing attacker blob, and chase the opponent's defending blob with your attacking blob.

When the blobs make contact, health will drain from the defending blob.

Win by reducing you opponent's health bar to 0 before they do yours.

(Also supports 1 v CPU)
